%description
One of the features of Python that makes it so powerful is the ability to take
existing libraries, written in C or C++, and make them available as Python
extension modules. Such extension modules are often called bindings for the
library.  SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for
C and C++ libraries. It was originally developed to create PyQt, the Python
bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for any C or
C++ library.  SIP comprises a code generator and a Python module. The code
generator processes a set of specification files and generates C or C++ code
which is then compiled to create the bindings extension module. The SIP Python
module provides support functions to the automatically generated code.  The
specification files contains a description of the interface of the C or C++
library, i.e. the classes, methods, functions and variables. The format of a
specification file is almost identical to a C or C++ header file, so much so
that the easiest way of creating a specification file is to edit the
corresponding header file.  SIP makes it easy to exploit existing C or C++
libraries in a productive interpretive programming environment. SIP also makes
it easy to take a Python application (maybe a prototype) and selectively
implement parts of the application (maybe for performance reasons) in C or
C++.
