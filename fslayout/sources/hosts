# hosts
#    This file describes a number of hostname-to-address mappings for the 
#    TCP/IP subsystem.  It is mostly used at boot time, when no name servers
#    are running. On small systems, this file can be used instead of a DNS
#    server. 
#    Just add the names, addresses and any aliases to the file.
#    By the way, Arnt Gulbrandsen <agulbra@nvg.unit.no> says that 127.0.0.1
#    should NEVER be named with the name of the machine.  It causes problems
#    for some (stupid) programs, irc and reputedly talk. :^)
#
# Format is:
# IPADDRESS         FQDN                        ALIASES

# For loopbacking.
127.0.0.1           localhost.localdomain
