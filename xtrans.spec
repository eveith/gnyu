%description
xtrans is a library of code that is shared among various X packages to handle
network protocol transport in a modular fashion, allowing a single place to
add new transport types. It is used by the X server, libX11, libICE, the
X font server, and related components.
It is however, *NOT* a shared library, but code which each consumer includes
and builds it's own copy of with various #ifdef flags to make each copy slightly
different. To support this in the modular build system, this package simply
installs the C source files into $(prefix)/include/X11/Xtrans and installs a
pkg-config file and an autoconf m4 macro file with the flags needed to use it.
